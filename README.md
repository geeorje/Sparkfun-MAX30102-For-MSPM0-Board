Hi!

This code is for the TI MSPM0+ Boards with CCS Syntax.
The code is for 2 sensors: Sparkfun MAX30102 and Sparkfun AD8232, which are both used to create a heart rate monitor
The MAX30102 is a board which uses I2C (files not provided for that) to communicate, and the AD8232 is an input that gives you a reading that needs to be connected to an onboard ADC.

Hope this helps!
