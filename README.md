Hi!

This code is for the TI MSPM0+ Boards with CCS Syntax.
The code is for 2 sensors: Sparkfun MAX30102 and Sparkfun AD8232, which are both used to create a heart rate monitor
The MAX30102 is a board which uses I2C (files not provided for that) to communicate, and the AD8232 is an input that gives you a reading that needs to be connected to an onboard ADC.

Most of the code is taken from the Sparkfun MAX30102 and AD8232 Arduino versions, but has been repurposed to be compatible with the MSPM0G3507 TI Microcontroller and CCS Syntax.


Hope this helps!
